## Mission Statement

**To provide the support and guidance required by Projects to thrive and
contribute to the overall mission and goals of OWASP.**

## Objectives and Tasks

The Project Committee intends to address these key problems:

- Currently, project management is a hard and sometimes tiring job
- Many projects do not feel sufficiently supported by OWASP

As one of the three legs that support OWASP (Foundation, Chapters and
Projects), Projects are a critical part of moving the OWASP mission
forward. The Project Committee's purpose is to help ensure that the
quality, lifecycle, and teams are supported as per the Project Committee
Scope.

## Scope

- Promote project activity, and provide mentorship and guidance to
  project leads and team members.
- Maintain the project lifecycle within OWASP, including working with
  staff to improve procedures, and documenting guidelines in an updated
  or re-written Project Handbook.
- Work with OWASP projects and establish any processes to assist
  projects to achieve flagship level status, including deleting,
  revising, or establishing a project review process
- Evangelize OWASP projects publicly, including working with outside
  projects to become OWASP projects.
- Provide first level dispute resolution for projects, which can be
  escalated to the Dispute Resolution process or in severe cases, the
  Foundation, Compliance Committee, or Board.
- Work with the Foundation to build operational automation and provide
  managed shared infrastructure for projects.
- Advise the Board or Foundation on relevant bylaws or policy changes.
