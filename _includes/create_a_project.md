## Creating a Project

Prior to creating a project, potential leaders should familiarize themselves with the current [project policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/projects). The project policy details the operational requirements and expectations for OWASP projects. To start a new project or re-open an archived project, please see the [New Project Request](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/70). Considering that projects require review and investigation and, occasionally, discussion in committee,
new project requests can take some time to resolve.

## The New Project Request

In order to prepare for submitting the [New Project Request](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/70), potential project leaders should consider the following.

### Project Name
The project name should be considered carefully. This name will be how most people find the project and how they associate the project with what it does. A good name is descriptive and indicates what the project is about. Although acronyms are commonly used to refer to established projects, a good name tries to avoid this initially.

### Project Leaders
Gather the names, email addresses, and Github usernames of the project leaders. These will be needed when starting a project so that leaders can be contacted and so that they may have access to the project repository which will be created for them. Project leaders should strive to use their OWASP email addresses, where available, whenever communicating anything about the project.

### Project Information
Have a good idea of what your project is meant to address, including a short summary, a longer description, and a roadmap of what you want to accomplish in the near future. Having this information ready when a new project request is submitted demonstrates that a certain amount of thought has gone into the decision to create the project.

### Project License
A project should choose an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses/) or, in the case of documentation projects, the [Creative Commons BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license is recommended.

### Good Practices
Finally, you should make sure you review and understand the Project Committee's recommendations for [Project Good Practices](https://owasp.org/www-committee-project/#div-practice). These include reviewing current projects to determine if your project overlaps with existing projects, guidelines on vendor neutrality, and other topics.
